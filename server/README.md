# AMI Component Architecture

## Overview
The main `Ami.jsx` file has been refactored from a monolithic 1205-line file into smaller, organized components for better maintainability and scalability.

## Component Structure

### üìÅ `src/components/chat/` - Chat-Specific Components

#### `ChatHeader.jsx`
- **Purpose**: Handles the top header section of the chat interface
- **Features**: Menu toggle button, Ami branding with animated logo, online status indicator
- **Importance**: Provides consistent navigation and branding across the chat interface

#### `ChatWindow.jsx`
- **Purpose**: Main container for displaying chat messages
- **Features**: Auto-scrolling, scroll position tracking, message rendering with animations
- **Importance**: Core chat functionality - manages message display and user interaction with chat history

#### `MessageBubble.jsx`
- **Purpose**: Renders individual chat messages (both user and bot)
- **Features**: Animated message bubbles, rich content support (charts, quizzes, flashcards), glassmorphism effects
- **Importance**: Provides consistent message styling and supports interactive content types

#### `MessageInput.jsx`
- **Purpose**: Complex input component for sending messages
- **Features**: File uploads, drag-drop support, image previews, menu system, auto-resize textarea
- **Importance**: Primary user interaction point - handles all input methods and file attachments

#### `Sidebar.jsx`
- **Purpose**: Navigation sidebar with conversation history
- **Features**: Conversation list, new chat button, responsive mobile behavior
- **Importance**: Provides navigation between different chat sessions and quick access to chat management

#### `TypingIndicator.jsx`
- **Purpose**: Shows animated dots when AI is responding
- **Features**: Three animated dots with staggered timing
- **Importance**: Provides visual feedback during AI response generation

#### `WelcomePrompts.jsx`
- **Purpose**: Landing page welcome messages that rotate
- **Features**: Cycling through different welcome messages with smooth transitions
- **Importance**: Creates engaging first impression and guides users on what they can do

### üìÅ `src/components/ui/` - General UI Components

#### `AnimatedBackground.jsx`
- **Purpose**: Provides the animated background for the entire application
- **Features**: Gradient orbs, floating particles, grid patterns, smooth animations
- **Importance**: Creates the immersive visual experience and modern aesthetic

## Main `Ami.jsx` - Orchestration Layer
- **Purpose**: Coordinates all components and manages global state
- **Responsibilities**:
  - State management (messages, sidebar, typing status)
  - Message handling and routing
  - Component composition and layout
  - Business logic for chat interactions

## Benefits of This Architecture

1. **Modularity**: Each component has a single responsibility
2. **Reusability**: Components can be easily reused in other parts of the app
3. **Maintainability**: Easier to debug, test, and update individual features
4. **Scalability**: Simple to add new features or modify existing ones
5. **Team Collaboration**: Multiple developers can work on different components simultaneously
6. **Code Clarity**: Much easier to understand and navigate the codebase

## File Size Reduction
- **Before**: 1 file with 1205 lines
- **After**: 9 organized files with ~150-200 lines each
- **Result**: 85% reduction in individual file complexity

This modular approach follows React best practices and makes the AMI chatbot much more maintainable and extensible for future development.
